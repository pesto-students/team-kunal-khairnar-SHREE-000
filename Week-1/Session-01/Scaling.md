Scaling in web applications refers to the process of handling increased traffic, user demand, and data processing requirements as an application grows in size and popularity. It involves ensuring that the application can handle the increased load efficiently, maintain performance, and provide a smooth user experience.

1. Horizontal scaling: 
This technique concerns scaling the number of servers to meet the demands of the dramatic increase in user requests. As a result, the number of requests each server receives is minimized as several servers share the workload.

2. Vertical scaling: 
As opposed to horizontal scaling, vertical scaling deals with adding more vigorous CPUs, memory, or resources for I/O operations. It can also include replacing an existing server with a super-powerful server.
