Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.

1. Keyword research: 
Identify relevant keywords and phrases that users are likely to search for. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or SEMrush to find high-volume and low-competition keywords.

2. On-page optimization: 
Ensure that each page on your website has a unique and descriptive title tag, meta description, and relevant headers (H1, H2, etc.). Include target keywords naturally in these elements.

3. URL structure: 
Create user-friendly and search engine-friendly URLs that include relevant keywords and provide a clear hierarchy of content. For example, use "www.example.com/category/page" instead of "www.example.com/?p=123".

4. Mobile optimization: 
Make sure your website is mobile-friendly and responsive. Mobile optimization is crucial as search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their rankings. Test your site using Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool.

5. Page speed optimization: 
Optimize your website's loading speed by minimizing file sizes, enabling compression, leveraging browser caching, and reducing the number of HTTP requests. Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights can provide insights and suggestions for improvement.

6. Schema markup: 
Implement structured data using schema.org markup to provide search engines with additional information about your website's content. This can enhance the display of your website in search results and improve visibility.

7. Optimized images: 
Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality. Use descriptive file names and alt tags that include relevant keywords to help search engines understand the content of the images.

8. Secure website: 
Switch to HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to ensure a secure connection. Search engines prioritize secure websites, and it also builds trust with users.

9. User experience (UX) optimization: 
Create a user-friendly website by focusing on intuitive navigation, clear calls-to-action, and easy-to-use interfaces. Good UX can increase user engagement and reduce bounce rates, which can positively impact search engine rankings.

10. High-quality content: 
Create informative, engaging, and well-structured content that provides value to users. Incorporate target keywords naturally into the content, headings, and meta tags. Regularly update and add fresh content to your website.

11. Link building: 
Develop a backlink strategy to acquire high-quality, authoritative links from other websites. This can be done through guest posting, outreach, content promotion, and creating link-worthy content.

12. 
Social media integration: Integrate social sharing buttons to encourage users to share your content on social media platforms. Increased social signals can indirectly influence search engine rankings.
