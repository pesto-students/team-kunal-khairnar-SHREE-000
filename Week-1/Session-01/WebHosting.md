Web hosting refers to the service of providing storage space and resources on a server that enables individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. In simpler terms, web hosting allows you to publish your website or web application online, making it available for visitors to access via their web browsers.

1. Shared Hosting
With shared hosting, your account and websites will share resources with other hosting accounts on that server.

2. VPS hosting
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) web hosting plan combines dedicated and shared web hosting features. The website content is hosted within virtually-partitioned sections on the web server to mimic a dedicated server while still sharing the server among multiple users. 

3. Dedicated Hosting
With dedicated hosting, you have an entire physical server just for your site(s). You get everything and you don’t need to share it with anyone else.

5. Colocation Hosting
Colocation hosting is an advanced type of hosting that’s really only used by large businesses.
With colocation hosting, you physically own the hosting hardware. That is, you’ll actually purchase the hosting servers that you want to use. However, you rent space in another company’s data center to have that company power and maintain that hardware for you.
