<!-- Add a keyframe called moveFraction that does the following:
○ At 0% sets the font color to yellow and uses transform property to translate to
position (-355px, 60px) so the fraction is off the left side of the screen.
○ At 50% translates to (0px, 60px) so the fraction is just below and right of the
question.
○ At 100% sets font color to red and translates to (0px, 0px) so the fraction is
located next to the = sign.
● In the #answer rule start the moveFraction animation 1 second after the CSS loads, and
make the animation duration 2 seconds.
● In the #answer rule use animation-fill-mode: forwards to keep the fraction
from resetting back to the original location after the animation completes.
● Add a transition property to the #question rule to perform a transform over 0.6
seconds with the ease-in-out timing function.
● Add a transform property to the #question:hover rule to scale by 0.9. -->
