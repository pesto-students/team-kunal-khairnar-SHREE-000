The ACID properties are a set of characteristics that guarantee the reliability and consistency of database transactions. These properties are crucial in ensuring that database operations are carried out in a predictable and reliable manner, even in the presence of system failures. ACID is an acronym that stands for:

Atomicity --->

Atomicity ensures that a database transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It guarantees that either all the operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.
If any part of a transaction fails (e.g., due to a system crash or a constraint violation), the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state. No partial changes are allowed to be persisted in the database.
Atomicity is essential to maintain data consistency.

Consistency --->

Consistency ensures that a database transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another.
It enforces integrity constraints and ensures that the database is in a valid state both before and after the transaction. If a transaction violates any integrity constraint, it is rolled back.
Consistency guarantees that a transaction will not compromise the integrity of the data.

Isolation ---> 

Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction is executed as if it were the only one running, even in a multi-user, multi-threaded database environment.
Isolation levels define the extent to which transactions are isolated from one another. Common isolation levels include Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable.
Higher isolation levels provide stronger guarantees against data anomalies but can lead to increased contention and reduced performance.

Durability ---> 

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanently stored in the database, and they survive system failures, such as crashes or power outages.
This property is typically achieved by writing the transaction's changes to non-volatile storage (e.g., disk) before confirming the transaction's success.
Durability guarantees that committed transactions are not lost, and the database can recover to a consistent state after a system failure.
