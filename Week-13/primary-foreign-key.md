Primary keys and foreign keys are fundamental concepts in relational databases that establish relationships between tables. They play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and maintaining referential integrity.

Primary Key --->

A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in that table. It ensures that there are no duplicate records in the table.

Each table in a relational database should have a primary key.

The primary key enforces data integrity by preventing the insertion of duplicate or null values.

In most database systems, primary keys are automatically indexed, which can improve query performance.

The primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns, known as a composite primary key.

Primary keys can be of different types, including integers, strings, or any other data type, depending on the requirements of the database schema.  


Foreign Key --->

A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. It creates a relationship between tables.

The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, creating a parent-child relationship.

Foreign keys ensure referential integrity, which means that the values in the referencing table (child) must match the values in the referenced table (parent).

Foreign keys help maintain data consistency and prevent or cascade updates and deletes between related tables.
