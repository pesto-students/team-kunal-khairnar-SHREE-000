**Step 3: Create API Endpoints**

1. **Data of Multiple Cities:**
   - Set up an API route (e.g., `/cities`) in your route file (e.g., `weatherRoutes.js`) that accepts query parameters for city name, city code, and pagination.
   - Define a route handler in the controller (e.g., `weatherController.js`) to process this request.
   - Use the weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.com) to fetch data for multiple cities based on the provided filters (city name and code) and pagination (page and limit).
   - Construct the request to the weather API by appending the query parameters.
   - Handle the response from the weather API and return the data to the client.

2. **Detailed Forecast for X Days:**
   - Create an API route (e.g., `/forecast`) that accepts the desired number of days (X) as a query parameter in your route file.
   - Implement a route handler in the controller to process this request.
   - Utilize the weather API to retrieve detailed forecast data for the specified number of days.
   - Construct the request to the weather API, including the number of forecast days.
   - Handle the response from the weather API and return the detailed forecast data to the client.

3. **Filter Data by City, Date, and Moment:**
   - Implement an API route (e.g., `/filter`) in your route file that accepts query parameters for city, date, and moment.
   - Create a route handler in the controller to handle this request.
   - Use the weather API or your stored data to filter and return relevant weather information based on the specified parameters (city, date, and moment).
   - Construct the request to the weather API with appropriate query parameters for filtering.
   - Handle the response and return the filtered data to the client.

4. **Current Weather Conditions of a Specific City:**
   - Set up an API route (e.g., `/current`) that takes the city name as a query parameter in your route file.
   - Define a route handler in the controller to process this request.
   - Fetch current weather conditions for the specified city from the weather API by constructing the request with the city parameter.
   - Handle the response from the weather API and return the current weather conditions to the client.

These steps outline the process of creating API endpoints for your Weather App backend service to provide functionalities for fetching weather data based on different criteria. Make sure to handle errors gracefully and validate user input to ensure data integrity and security.
